Quick Start
==========================

Run Server
-------------------------------
Start server with the following command::

    $ ./bin/gospatial

The server's default port is 8080. You can change the port by including ``-p <PORT>``. Example::

    $ ./bin/gospatial -p 8888

The server also has a default Bolt (`https://github.com/boltdb/bolt`) database it will create and access called `bolt.db`. Upon first launching the API server this database will be created in the applications main directory. If you wish to write to a different database or change were this database is located, you can pass in the following argument when launching the server: ``-db <database>``.

Example::

    $ ./bin/gospatial -db test.db
