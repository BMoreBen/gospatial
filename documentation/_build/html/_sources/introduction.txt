The basis of this API server is to easily create, store and serve geospatial data to other webmapping apps. The core app is built off of Gorilla's Mux and Websocket in addition to bolt.

The GoSpatial is a geospatial api server written in GoLang. The app is built over three commonly used GoLang packages which makes installation straight forward.
